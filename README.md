## Week 8 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

- This app will initially display a few of my favorite football clubs. If the user
selects a given club, their team name, city and country will be displayed along
with a list of current players
- On the main page, the user may also add their own team to the list of profiles
- After a team is added, the new team will display on the home page.
- If the user selects a given team, they will be able to delete the team, update the
team or they may add players to the team.
- If a given team is deleted, all of their players will be deleted as well.
- In the next version, users will be able to delete or update players and add their
favorite youtube highlight video for their team to be displayed when the team is
chosen.
- This app incorporates bootstrap.
